### Notes

Apologies for the jank code in some areas, the separate swappable heads is almost ready to be used but I ran out of time. You can modify it using the included aseprite files to get the headless version if ya want!

All Level Files need to be opened with [LDTK](https://ldtk.io/). The game ends when you reach a boss and defeat it, but you can add as many levels BEFORE that as you want and just change the boss level's name.

One of my main areas of improvement for gamefeel is the hitstop, which are pause frames for the game after you deal/take a hit. It was set at 5 when the base fps of all animations was 10, but now it might be too short. You can mess with it and see what feels best!

I fully intended this to be moddable, and I hope to continue documenting the code in the future. We also fully intend to polish this up and realize our original goal for a full Newgrounds release :O
